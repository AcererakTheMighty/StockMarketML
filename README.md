# StockMarketML
This repository is a series of ML algorithms created in Colab that each deal with the Stock Market and predicting outcomes of various stock prices. 

StockMarketProject 1: A basic algorithm designed to predict the prices of Apple stock. The tutorial I used was moderately outdated, so I had to troubleshoot. For example, the web.DataReader module didn't work for me, so instead I had to use the yfinance module. This worked well all the way up until the end, where I couldn't see what the actual price was compared to the prediction. I will obviously be working on this.
